# Haptic Glove Connectivity Program

It has always been a challenge for the visually impaired (VI) to access the Web, let alone buy or transact items online. This paper looks to tackle this problem by optimizing and integrating haptic technology onto an e-commerce website that is targeted for the VI. With a haptic device and the creation of 3D objects with texture and material, the VI are allowed to feel objects with a stylus to gain a more realistic perception of the virtual 3D objects.

* Therefore, this interactive program allows the arduino haptic glove to connect with a javaFX application, hence, introduce allowing user to change the shape of the glove by using a GUI.

## Functionality:
* A Clean Java FX GUI
* Program is able to interact with the arduino and control its servo motor to control the position of the user's fingers
* Allows user to create preset of positioning of 4 different motors
* Write and read from CVS file for easy store and retrieve of data

## Example/ Demo:
